                        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Ken shih, and I am very happy and honored to
                            participate UCLA coding bootcamp. I just graduated from Cal Poly Pomona,
                            and my major is computer information system. My interests are playing basketball,
                            singing and watching movie. Throughout this bootcamp journey, I believe that I will
                            gain knowlege and skills from the bootcamp, and I can become successful software developer
                            in the future!
